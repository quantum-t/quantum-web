She gave advice on dealing with colleagues and difficult situations. Two years on and life for me is very different; I have a new job and I know for certain that I wouldn't have had the confidence to go for that job interview if it hadn't been for Mary-Beth.",

In just 18 months, I can sense a change within me to see things differently, shift my mindset to accept change, calm myself down in complex situations and most importantly stepping up to take more challenge and helping others in every possible way.  I cannot thank Mary-Beth enough for her time mentoring me, guiding me to the path I am walking. I must agree as she says “the greatest feeling is when you help others to become the best leaders they can be and that’s how you leave a legacy”",

Not only does Mary-Beth provide leaders with a comprehensive guide to navigating organisational change, she does so with her own unique flair and personal experiences. “In One Piece” a must-have for any leader or reader who wants to make sense of challenging situations, and this work could not have come at a more ideal time given the changes that COVID-19 has thrust upon us all.
